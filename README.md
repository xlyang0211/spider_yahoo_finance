The project description for repos on GitHub is taken from a file in the project's root directory:
README.md.
This file should contain the following pieces of information:
1. A description of your project
2. Links to the project's ReadTheDocs page
3. A TravisCI button showing the state of the build
4. "Quickstart" documentation (how to quickly install and use your project)
5. A list of non-Python dependencies (if any) and how to install them
